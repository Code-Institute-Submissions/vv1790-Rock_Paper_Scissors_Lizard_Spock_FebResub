The whole project is created with one html file. So there is no navbar.

Which offers the option to start the game over.

<h2>Bugs and Testing</h2>

This game went through a lot of changes which can be tracked in the repository's history. The JavaScript part of the project posed the biggest 

challenge. I've attempted to try and write a more complex code for the computer to become a tougher challange. That, however, resulted

in unexpected bugs to appear. Thus, I decided to use the tried and tested Math.random approach. Programming the buttons was

quite challenging as well, the first version relied on onclick functions. Later during the develompent I decided 

to go the addEventListener route.
